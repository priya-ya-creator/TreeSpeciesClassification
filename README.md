# ðŸŒ¿ Tree Species Classification

A machine learning project focused on classifying different species of trees using supervised learning techniques. The project utilizes various features of tree data and applies models like Decision Trees and Random Forest to predict the correct species.

This repository includes:

ðŸ“˜ Tree_Species_Classification.ipynb â€“ A Jupyter Notebook that builds a model to classify tree species based on image data.
ðŸ“¦ Tree_classification_dataset.zip â€“ The dataset used for training and testing the classification model.
