# 🌿 Tree Species Classification

A machine learning project focused on classifying different species of trees using supervised learning techniques. The project utilizes various features of tree data and applies models like Decision Trees and Random Forest to predict the correct species.

This repository includes:

📘 Tree_Species_Classification.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook that builds a model to classify tree species based on image data.
📦 Tree_classification_dataset.zip – The dataset used for training and testing the classification model.

📌 Features
📸 Image-Based Classification
Classifies tree species using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from uploaded images.

🧭 Geo-Intelligent Recommendations
Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with geolocation data (latitude, longitude, native status, diameter) to recommend likely species for a given area.

🌐 Interactive Web Interface
Built with Streamlit for smooth, user-friendly interaction and visual feedback.

📊 Big Data Integration
Processes and visualizes over 1.38 million urban tree records from 50+ U.S. cities.

☁️ Deployment Ready
Streamlit app optimized for cloud deployment (Heroku/Streamlit Cloud/Docker).
